## Task
```
Using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ as backend,
write an imitation of a typical chat interface: on the left is a list of contacts, on the right is messages.
Clicking on a contact opens a chat with the specified person. At the top of the chat should be displayed full name and
avatar of the selected person, at the bottom - a form for sending a message. New messages (after sending)
should appear below.
```
